# Repo of exercises

This repository contains all of the mathematics and programming exercises that I
solved when reading textbooks.

Therefore, this repo is intended mainly as an academic portfolio. Each of my
developed projects is contained in its own repository —you can browse
them either in my GitHub profile or use my resume/portfolio—.

**Note**: I am currently taking the *Fundamentals of Statistics* and the
*Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data* courses of the MITx
MicroMasters program in Statistics and Data Science. Thus, I will not make
the solutions of the problem sets public until the courses are over. If, as a
part of a recruitment process, you want to see my solutions, you can ask me for
them and I will gladly provide them.

The structure of this repo is as follows:
