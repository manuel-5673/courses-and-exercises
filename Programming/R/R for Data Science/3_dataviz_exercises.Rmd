These are the exercises of the chapter 3 of *R for Data Science*

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


##3.2 - First steps

1. Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

We can observe an empty "canvas", that is, the area on which we cad add layers
to create a plot.

2. How many rows are in `mpg`? How many columns?



3. What does the `drv` variable describe?
