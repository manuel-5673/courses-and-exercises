The third chapter introduces the use of `ggplot` for data visualization (the
first two chapters are an introduction to the book).

It's required to have `tidyverse` installed to run this notebook:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## 3.2 - First steps

We'll use the `mpg` dataset (included in the `ggplot` package)

```{r}
mpg
```

To create a plot, we'd use:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

* `ggplot()` creates a coordinate system.
* `geom_point()` adds the geom of scatter plot.

The most basic template for graphics with `ggplot` is

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```
