# R For Data Science

### Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund

This folder contains the exercises and examples of the book *R for Data
Science*, which has an [online version](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).

The libraries needed to run the code are all those contained in the `tidyverse` collection, as well as `nycflights13`, `gapminder` and `Lahman`. To install
them, you can run

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse","nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))
```

The examples are in R Notebooks, one notebook per chapter:
* Data exploration (the first two chapters are introductory)
  * 3 - Data visualization \[examples\] \[exercises\]
